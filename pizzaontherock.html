                                Pizza on the Rock provides a comprehensive suite

                                real-time order tracking, seamless customer
                                communication, and personalized promotions based
                                on consumer data. The app ensures a smooth and
                                cost-effective delivery experience by
                                eliminating high commissions and additional
                                charges imposed by third-party services.
                                Leveraging extensive user research and market

                                conducting in-depth user research and market
                                analysis to understand the unique challenges
                                faced by restaurant owners and their customers.
                                I collaborated closely with the restaurant
                                owner, project managers, and engineers to
                                develop a user-centric design that addressed
                                these pain points. Throughout the project, I was
                                responsible for creating wireframes,
                                high-fidelity prototypes, and conducting
                                usability tests to ensure the app met user needs
                                and provided an exceptional user experience. My
                                focus was on delivering a solution that not only
                                streamlined delivery operations but also
                                enhanced customer satisfaction and business
                                efficiency.

                                Restaurant owners face significant challenges
                                with delivery apps like Swiggy and Zomato,
                                including high commission, additional fees for
                                users, and poor handling and delivery timing,
                                which reflect negatively on their business.
                                Furthermore, they lack access to consumer data,
                                limiting customer interaction and up-selling
                                opportunities. During peak times, these
                                platforms may take restaurants offline or
                                struggle with rider availability, exacerbating
                                issues and forcing owners to comply with
                                unfavourable terms.

                                A/B testing allowed us to compare different

                                data on which elements performed best. Alongside
                                this, iterative design testing enabled
                                continuous improvement by incorporating user

                                The application's streamlined interface led to a
                                <span class="highlight">40%</span> increase in
                                user confidence. According to feedback from
                                early users like Priya Arora, "Navigating
                                through the app feels effortless, making
                                managing investments a breeze.” The revamped
                                design resulted in a
                                <span class="highlight">25%</span> decrease in
                                user errors, enhancing overall usability.

                            <p>
                                This project highlighted the significance of
                                balancing user-centric design with business
                                objectives. I gained valuable insights into the
                                complexities of the food delivery ecosystem,
                                particularly the challenges faced by both users
                                and restaurant owners. Through iterative design
                                and continuous feedback loops, I learned the
                                importance of adaptability in refining the
                                product to meet evolving user expectations while
                                aligning with the client's goals. This
                                experience deepened my understanding of creating
                                solutions that are both practical and impactful.
