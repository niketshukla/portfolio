                                research, problem definition, and
                                testing, driving usability and A/B testing to
                                create a user-centric, regulation-compliant
                                experience. -->
                                I led the end-to-end design process for the TMS
                                Fleet Management System, from discovery to
                                delivery, ensuring the solution aligned with
                                FMCSA regulations while solving real user
                                challenges. This included planning and
                                conducting user research, interviews, and data
                                analysis to uncover compliance and operational
                                pain points, then translating those insights
                                into clear problem definitions that guided
                                ideation. I created user flows, information
                                architecture, wireframes, and high-fidelity
                                prototypes, iterating through usability and A/B
                                testing to refine the experience. Partnering
                                closely with Product Managers, Engineers, and UI
                                Developers, I ensured that business goals and
                                technical constraints were met without
                                compromising usability. My work spanned
                                research, strategy, interaction design, visual
                                design, and validation, resulting in a
                                user-centric, regulation-compliant platform that
                                improved safety, compliance, and operational
                                efficiency.

                                Carrier companies and truck drivers struggled
                                with fragmented systems that made compliance
                                difficult, increased safety violations, and led
                                to penalties. Drivers lacked an intuitive way to
                                track Hours of Service (HOS), resulting in
                                excessive working hours, fatigue-related
                                incidents, and violations due to missed breaks
                                or inaccurate logs. Carrier companies faced
                                challenges obtaining real-time driver data,
                                complicating audits and increasing fines for
                                incomplete records. Without automated logging
                                and alerts, frequent errors and manual
                                corrections reduced efficiency and safety. The
                                goal was to design a research-driven and
                                user-centric solution that simplified

                                    I used Affinity Mapping to analyze user
                                    research, grouping insights from interviews
                                    and surveys to identify key patterns. This
                                    helped uncover pain points, prioritize
                                    solutions, and align design decisions with
                                    user needs, compliance challenges, and
                                    operational inefficiencies.

                                Throughout my time working on TMS, I've learned
                                the importance of gathering as much user
                                feedback in the early phase of a project, by
                                fostering open communication channels and
                                working closely with stakeholders. As user needs
                                evolved and new insights emerged, being able to
                                pivot and iterate on the design ensured that we
                                stayed responsive to user feedback and delivered
                                a product that met their expectations.
